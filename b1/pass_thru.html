<div class="comments"><b>Comments</b>
<p>Pass Thru is proper from a Right-Hand Mini-Wave because of the Ocean Wave Rule. It is the
same as Step Thru.</p>

<p>Pass Thru is improper from a Left-Hand Mini-Wave because of the left shoulder pass. Use Step Thru
instead.</p>

<p>Pass Thru from a Left-Hand Ocean Wave, making use of an implicit "those who can", and expecting
only the centers to be active is rarely used and goes against dancer expectation. Use "Centers Pass
Thru" or "Centers Step Thru" instead.</p>

<p>From a Squared Set, Heads Pass Thru is proper. It ends with the Heads back on Squared Set spots.
See Squared Set Convention.</p>

<p>Pass Thru is improper from dancers who are further apart than directly facing, or on a diagonal with
respect to each other. Using a phrase like "Boys On A Diagonal, Pass Thru", the caller can accomplish
the desired dance action.</p>

<p>Pass Thru is proper from a Couple facing an individual Dancer. In this case, the Dancer splits the
couple, having the effect of passing one dancer right shoulders and the other dancer left shoulders.</p></div>
