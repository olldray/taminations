<h2>Tag the Line (In/Out/Left/Right)</h2>

<div class="full">
<p>Starting formation - any line with an even
number of dancers. Each dancer turns to face the center of the line. Taking a short
side step to the left, each dancer walks forward passing right shoulders with oncoming
dancers until he has walked past all of the dancers from the other half of the line. The
call may be followed by any one of the directions In, Out, Right or Left. When this
happens, dancers turn in place one quarter (90&deg;) in the direction indicated.</p>

<p class="styling">STYLING: Arms in  natural dance position, hands ready to assume appropriate position for the next call. A flowing type of movement can be achieved by taking a slight step forward before turning toward the center of the line, thus avoiding the abrupt military type pivot.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 6 steps</p>
