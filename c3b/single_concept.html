<h2>Single Concept</h2>

<p><strong>Single</strong> is a way to take an 8-dancer call and make it a 4-dancer call;
or to take a 4-dancer call and make it a 2-dancer call.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Single</strong> version of a call, each dancer executes the movement
 that would normally be done by a set of two dancers within the normal
 version of the call. Hence, for a call to have a <strong>Single</strong> version,
 it must be possible to group all dancers into sets of two,
 in which the dancers in each set are always facing the
 same direction thoughout the given call.
 The dancers in each set are usually dancing their portion of the call

 <a href="../c2/once_removed_concept.html">Once Removed</a>, or
 <a href="twosome_concept.html">Twosome</a>
 (or some combination of these concepts).</p>

<p>You can think of <strong>Single</strong> as replacing each set of two dancers
 with a single dancer located exactly half-way between the two dancers.
  This single dancer then executes the given call always staying on a path
  located exactly half-way between where the two dancers would be
  in the normal version of the call.</p>
