<title>Twosome Concept</title>

<h2>Twosome Concept</h2>

<p>A <strong>Twosome</strong> consists of two dancers working as a unit and
obeying the following set of rules:</p>

    <ol><li>Throughout the given call,
    dancers retain their geographical orientation in the square
    with respect to the other dancer in their Twosome unit.
    This means that a dancer who started on the north side of their
    Twosome unit must always remain on the north side throughout the entire call.</li>

    <li>The two dancers in the Twosome unit are working as if
    they are one dancer. Therefore, as with concepts such as
    <a href="../c1/tandem_concept.html">Tandem</a>,
    <a href="../a1/as_couples.html">As Couples</a>, or
    <a href="../c2/solid_concept.html">Solid</a>,
    never allow any other dancers to come between or break up the
    Twosome unit. The dancers within the
    Twosome unit must always be facing the same direction.</li></ol>

<p>The caller will usually designate who is to work as a
Twosome by saying <strong>Couples Twosome</strong>,
<strong>Tandem Twosome</strong>, or <strong>Siamese Twosome</strong>.
If it is unambiguous as to which dancers are paired, the caller may simply say Twosome.</p>
