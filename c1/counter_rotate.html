<h2>Counter Rotate</h2>
<p>
From any formation with no dancers facing directly
toward or away from the flagpole center: Each dancer
moves forward the designated number of quarters (1/4
unless otherwise specified) around the flagpole center of
the formation, staying the same distance from that
center as though he were on a wheel turning about that
center. With each quarter he Counter Rotates, the
dancer faces a new wall (i.e., he turns 90&deg;).</p>

The original outsides always finish as outsides, and the
original centers always finish as centers. For example,
"Points Counter Rotate 1/4":</p>

Teaching Hint: From parallel waves, people tend to try to <a href="../a2/split_counter_rotate.html">
Split Counter Rotate</a>. Describing the action, from that
formation only, as "<a href="concentric_concept.html">Concentric</a> <a href="../a2/box_counter_rotate.html">Box Counter
Rotate</a>" helps
a great deal.</p>
