<title>Magic Column Formation/Concept</title>

<h2>Magic Column Formation/Concept</h2>
<p>A Magic Column consists of the ends of one column and the
centers of the other column. The dancers act as though
they were in a column together, beginning and ending on
those four spots.</p>
<p>Do the call as usual, but if you move from end to center or
center to end, follow the Magic Column Circulate path.
Note that a single magic column is neither right- nor
left-handed. You must follow the Magic traffic pattern, and
perform any action using the hand appropriate to your
position at that point in the call.
