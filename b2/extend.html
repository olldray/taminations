<h2>Extend</h2>

<div class="full">
<p>Extend involves dancers moving forward from one tagging formation to the next. There are five eight-dancer tagging
formations, which, in order, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Double Pass Thru (Zero Tag)</li>
<li>1/4 Tag</li>
<li>Ocean Waves (1/2 Tag)</li>
<li>3/4 Tag</li>
<li>Completed Double Pass Thru (Full Tag)</li>
</ol>
<p>This call was originally named "Extend the Tag". In 1988, the name was shortened to "Extend", without changing
the dance action.</p>

Dancers in the wave release handholds and step forward to the couple they are
facing and form an ocean wave. If the original wave was right-handed, form a
right-hand wave. If the original wave was left-handed, form a left-hand wave.

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
If you were a Center in the starting wave, you’ll be a Center in the ending wave.
If you were an End in the starting wave, you’ll be an End in the ending wave.
Stress that ALL dancers must move forward to keep the square from spreading out too far.
